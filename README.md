ARM LPC 2138-48 embedded system that demonstrate the numerical calculation of scientific calculator.
The new version µVision5 does not support many of the devices that were supported in the older versions yet. LPC2148 is one of the devices that are not supported. Hence, we need to add this device after successfully installing µVision5.

To do this, go to the following link and download the executable file for Legacy Support for ARM7, ARM9, and Cortex-R: http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/legacy

Download the Legacy support for the version of MDK downloaded and installed.
